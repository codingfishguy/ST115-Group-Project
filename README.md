# ST115-Group-Project

Examining Student and Online perceptions of LSE

This is the ST115 Group Project.

Main Research Questions
-	How does LSE student satisfaction compare to other universities?
-	How has LSE student satisfaction evolved over the last few years (2020-2023)?
-	How does student satisfaction in LSE vary by degree?
-	How is LSE perceived by people online? (E.g. Reddit, student room)
-	Does LSE’s perceived ‘low’ student satisfaction relate to it being a London university? How does London university student satisfaction compare to universities outside of London?
