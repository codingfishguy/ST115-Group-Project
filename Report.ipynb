    "### Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before arriving at LSE, many students likely hear of the university's low student satisfaction rates. These impressions often gain traction on online forums such as Reddit, where anecdotal accounts tend to amplify perceptions of dissatisfaction. Therefore, it is worth exploring this topic, to understand how \"severe\" the problem is and whether the data fully aligns with the online perception of the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can explore the statement above through a series of focused questions:\n",
    "- How does LSE student satisfaction compare to other universities?\n",
    "- How does student satisfaction within LSE vary by degree?\n",
    "- How has LSE student satisfaction evolved over the last few years (2020-2023)?\n",
    "- How is LSE perceived by people online?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth considering what is meant by student satisfaction. Many data sources such as the National Student Survey break down student's views into categories such as teaching, course content, course organisation and resources. Meanwhile, online the focus tends to be on social opportunities, as well as societies. As \"student satisfaction\" is multifaceted we will be breaking down each question into the specific type of student satisfaction we are discussing, to avoid confusion. \n",

    "We are not interested in certain columns of the NSS data. So, we remove them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, since the NSS combines student's responses to the Questions into one overall \\\"Positivity Measure\\\", which is the proportion of respondents who gave a positive answer, we only need that, rather than the actual responses to the questions (e.g. Option 1, Option 2, etc.). This does lose some of the nÃºance to the data, but makes visualisation and understanding the data easier."
