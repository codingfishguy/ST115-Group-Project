    "\n",
    "Before arriving at LSE, many students likely hear of the university's low student satisfaction rates. These impressions often gain traction on online forums such as Reddit, where anecdotal accounts tend to amplify perceptions of dissatisfaction. Additionally, multiple university ranking websites also present LSE as having a comparatively low student satisfaction rate. Therefore, it is worth exploring this topic, to understand how \"severe\" the problem is and whether the data fully aligns with the online perception of the university.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can explore the statement above through a series of focused questions:\n",
    "- How does LSE student satisfaction compare to other universities?\n",
    "- How does student satisfaction within LSE vary by degree?\n",
    "- How has LSE student satisfaction evolved over the last few years (2020-2023)?\n",
    "- How is LSE perceived by people online?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth considering what is meant by student satisfaction. Many data sources such as the National Student Survey break down student's views into categories such as teaching, course content, course organisation and assessment. Meanwhile, online the focus tends to be on social opportunities, as well as societies. As \"student satisfaction\" is multifaceted we will be breaking down each question into the specific type of student satisfaction we are discussing, to avoid confusion. The NSS is generally better suited towards 'academic' related definitions of student satisfaction, such as student's views on the quality of the course, the teaching etc. whilst Reddit and online platforms likely better represent student's thoughts on their social lives at certain universities.\n",

    "We can answer many of the questions through the NSS. The NSS questions students on multiple different categories, such as teaching quality, course quality and assessment quality. Most websites ignore this distinction and simply focus on one of these metrics such as teaching quality, however, we wanted to make the distinction between categories clearer. As there are multiple categories, we create multiple dataframes so that visualisation is easier. Another important thing to consider is the response to population size; if it is high it means the measure of student satisfaction is more likely to accurately represent the real student body, compared to if it is low, when the results are less robust. This is the reason why many online displays of these metrics leave out universities like the University of Oxford, where a hefty proportion of the students boycott the NSS. However, we decided to still compare Oxford to LSE, whilst acknowledging this potential issue with the data."

So we grouped subjects we felt were humanities against the more quantitative subjects. Business and management was classed as Quantitative since it encompassed Finance and Management at the LSE, which both require compulsory mathematics courses, so we chose to include those within the quantitative category. \n",

During Covid we went to online assessment, which resulted in the average shooting up. We returned to a proctored exam last year, and the the average was 38%. This was the 2021 intake (its a Year 2 module). A lot have failed other modules so will be deregistered. Some have quit before they are pushed. Its absolutely not their fault and it's really sad. Their A-levels were severely interrupted, they never learnt how to study properly, and they were totally demoralised. Unfortunately, I think the government will just forget about them.

       "1  I'm an admissions tutor and lecturer. I teach a fairly challenging module but it's actually quite popular and the final average was about 65%. During Covid we went to online assessment, which resulted in the average shooting up. We returned to a proctored exam last year, and the the average was 38%. This was the 2021 intake (its a Year 2 module). A lot have failed other modules so will be deregistered. Some have quit before they are pushed. Its absolutely not their fault and it's really sad. Their A-levels were severely interrupted, they never learnt how to study properly, and they were totally demoralised. Unfortunately, I think the government will just forget about them. I worry they'll become a lost cohort like the Japanese kids who graduated during the Pacific financial crisis.  \n",
