Do you agree with the 2024 Completeuniguide rankings?,1067,These are so pointless‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs entirely dependent on the course and the individual.
In what world are international students living in?? The lack of class consciousness is crazy,752,[deleted]
"I live in Paris, but the medical campus of UCL is so pretty",344,Wait till you turn around and see the portico üòÇüòÇ
why are masters degrees so expensive?,203,"This doesn't really apply to most masters courses if you are a domestic student, the MFin looks aimed at people who already have professional experience which makes it quite different to most other masters. Even at Cambridge  most course are around ¬£12k so almost coverable with the student loan, but still you do need to find ¬£10k+ for living expenses from somewhere"
I regret my undergrad uni choice,190,"That was rude, but I think lots of academics wouldn't be mega interested in 'networking' with undergrads anyway. You don't have any work to talk about yet. Just feels like free teaching"

UCL will continue with Online Learning in Term 2 and Term 3,134,Durham told us they‚Äôd review in person teaching at the end of term 1 but on induction day they then told us the whole year is online.
Is there a recognition for grades above 80% in graduate degrees?,119,I got 81% on one assignment and an email to say well done keep up the good work lol
My teacher is discouraging me from applying to the uk,118,"To some degree, I would agree with your coordinator. However, I disagree at the same time. Why pay 18k a year for a decent uni in the UK if you can study for (almost) free at a similar status university in the EU like in Sweden, Germany or the Netherlands?

However, when attending Oxbridge, UCL, LSE or Imperial, it would be different in my books. Those universities have great international prestige. Then it can indeed be worth it to pay such fees.

By the way, screw coordinators anyways in secondary school. They told me I should never do university when I was 17. Now here we are."
Gap year worth it?,115,"A year out for UCL/KCL/Bristol maybe not. You'd get better connections, opportunities with firms etc, so it's definitely better. Cambridge it would be. A\*A\*A\* is great but obviously no guarantee that you'll get in to Camb, as other applicants have a similar profile.

Did you do LNAT this year? How it go?"
Idk where to post this mini rant but there are so many promoters in my uni WhatsApp group.,114,The chat is almost certainly owned by the event promoters.
"I realise beyond the very top, differences in university rankings are so negligible",113,I love how much this sub obsesses over rankings
UCL marking me absent even though I attended the lectures,111,Have you asked how it's happened? Tried to determine the root cause at all?
You can get Microsoft Office for FREE!!,108,You may also get windows 10 itself. Check out onthehub.com to see if your uni offers licenses for free.
Response from UCL‚Ä¶,112,Have you contacted them? No-one can answer here.
Existential crisis question- masters worth it?,98,"I'm in Leicester not london but for me even IT masters have like 98% international students with most of them going back home or doing a phd because there are no jobs that want to hire.

Either because international students need work visa sponsorship or don't have required 10 years of experience for entry level jobs."
Can I attend lectures outside of my course?,95,"Lecturer here. Typically it is best if you find out what you want to go to and email ahead to ask. It's usually never a problem unless there's a specific group event happening or, in one persistent case this semester, the visiting student starts to take over a bit and the vibes go off.

As many have said, you can just walk in to large classes and literally no one would have a clue, but the real action is in seminars and small group stuff."
Do you support the strikes on 1st - 3rd December?,92,"You're probably directing this at other students, so not for me to answer. But it's important to know that staff really, *really* don't want to strike. We just feel backed into a corner and it's the only option our employers have left.

From talking to students about it, most have been quite supportive and understanding of why this is happening. I just hope that students' (very justified) anger at this situation is directed at the employers and upper management causing the issue, and not the staff on the front line.

Lecturers just want to get on and teach, and striking loses us pay, and typically creates more work down the line in evaluating learning objectives of our courses. So, again, no one wants to be in this situation. But conditions within the sector have been sliding continually and people are fearful for the long-term prospects of an industry which should be world-leading.

I'm interested to see the thoughts of other students here."
God some freshers can be really pretentious,73,"You need to throw it back at them. ‚ÄúEw, UCL? Couldn‚Äôt get into Oxbridge or Imperial?‚Äù üòè There is also a long rivalry between KCL and UCL, so maybe the person was trying to play that up."
"""Manchester Metropolitan university is 200 years old"" Is this misleading?",76,Every university does something similar. Many businesses too.
Question to 2nd year students: when should 1st year uni students start looking for student houses/apartments with friends? For reference I am a student at UCL in London.,57,Ok going to provide a counterpoint to these comments - I went to Goldsmiths in zone 2 SE London and don't remember anyone finding a flat anywhere near this early. I think I sorted mine around July/August to move in September.
Do UCL admissions ever pick up phone calls?,57,Smoke signals. Worked for me.
Is Oxbridge worth it?,58,[deleted]
62 RESPONSES AWAY FROM TARGET - Academic Survey on Changes in Eating Habits During Pandemic [For UK residents],53,"Done it. Good luck, your research sounds really interesting."
Is living in uni dorms a good idea?,46,"Commuting 90 mins will be WAY worse than any halls situation. While your living standard may not be great, you‚Äôll be able to make many more friends and have a much more enjoyable time without having to worry about getting a train at the end of the day."
At which rank uni does the mindset change?,49,"Some people recognise at a younger age (&lt;18) that theres nothing wrong about being enthusiastic and enjoying studying subjects. They tend to do more work and get better grades then those who enjoy mucking about instead. You then get a pretty clear separation of people when they go to Uni.

I'd guess it gradual, with more keenos the higher up the ranks you go - rather than a cut off somewhere."
what's with the hate against KCL by those who don't even study there?,46,The student room hate anything thats not oxford or cambridge most often.
Advice on choosing university for Masters program,41,"If you plan to do a PhD the prestige of the school won't matter that much (especially given that both unis are well respected), your research proposal would matter most. Choose a supervisor for your master's dissertation who would add more weight to your PhD application and who could help you with connections."
Was too afraid to ask.,41,"For IT, the name of your uni probably matters less - what matters is that you are able to demonstrate your skillset and ideally have some internship experience. Depending on what area you want to go into, having a portfolio of your work can also be a good idea."
"Is it more difficult to obtain a high degree classification/grade at a more competitive university, such as Oxford, Cambridge, UCL etc?",40,Definitely. The exams are harder and the course is a lot more rigorous.
