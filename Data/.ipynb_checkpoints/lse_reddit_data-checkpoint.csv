The irony of LSE being a socialist institution,324,"Donâ€™t really want to give super identifying details but Iâ€™m currently a postgraduate student in LSE and although my programme isnâ€™t under the department of economics, Iâ€™m in an economics heavy programme. My professors are quite obviously pro-tax (heavily guided by data and evidence of course), pro-government regulations and interventions in the free market, pro-reform and redistribution through public administration and services, and actively teach us how to see through monopolies, inequalities, and undemocratic tactics administered in western free market countries (primarily the US). I think that we may still be considered centrists by hardcore socialists but we are clearly left wing compared to right wing, conservatives, libertarians, and whatever."
Got kicked outta LSE.....,234,"Can you share more details? Specifically.

Did you see a DR about such issues and have a record of it?

Did you apply for extenuating circumstances at all?

Was you offered a resit opportunity at all?

What is your grounds for appeal, and are you appealing only specifically the final fail decision?"
why are masters degrees so expensive?,205,"This doesn't really apply to most masters courses if you are a domestic student, the MFin looks aimed at people who already have professional experience which makes it quite different to most other masters. Even at Cambridge  most course are around Â£12k so almost coverable with the student loan, but still you do need to find Â£10k+ for living expenses from somewhere"
TIL some unis have worse graduate prospects than non-graduates,203,"I think people should bear in mind that Imperial only offers STEM and LSE focuses a lot of financial careers. That inflates the average salaries. In reality, the top 4 are very similar."

LSE bread ðŸ˜­ my DREAM uni offer!,146,Well done!
I've Ruined my Master's Degree and Ruined my Future,138,"Get help, now. You are clearly in crisis, and you are utterly overwhelmed. See your GP or CPN as a matter of urgency. Contact your uni and let them know what is going on.

You aren't even at the end of your masters, so how do you know your fucked it all up? Did the uni know about your diagnosis? Did you have accomodations? If not, then you need to talk to  them about it. Contact your SU, they are likely to have someone to help advocate your position to the uni. 

I doubt that you are stupid or unintelligent, you got into a masters at LSE so you can't be that thick! You are beating yourself up right now, it doesn't achieve anything other than making yourself feel worse. Please get help, you don't have to feel like this."
My teacher is discouraging me from applying to the uk,117,"To some degree, I would agree with your coordinator. However, I disagree at the same time. Why pay 18k a year for a decent uni in the UK if you can study for (almost) free at a similar status university in the EU like in Sweden, Germany or the Netherlands?

However, when attending Oxbridge, UCL, LSE or Imperial, it would be different in my books. Those universities have great international prestige. Then it can indeed be worth it to pay such fees.

By the way, screw coordinators anyways in secondary school. They told me I should never do university when I was 17. Now here we are."
"I realise beyond the very top, differences in university rankings are so negligible",115,I love how much this sub obsesses over rankings
How do people afford masters degrees?,113,"Savings, rich parents, sponsored by an employer."
Whatâ€™s with the poor student satisfaction at many of the well-regarded universities,109,"Student satisfaction and university reputation are not related; a good reputation is earned through world-class research output, not through doing a good job of looking after your students."
what to do with a philosophy degree?,94,"For the civil service, just be aware that the Diplomatic/Development Fast Stream is very, very competitive. Statistics here specify that the success rate was 0.2%, or over 16,000 applications for 28 roles (including the Economics Diplomats) in 2021. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-fast-stream-recruitment-data-2019-2020-and-2021 There are also the generalist and policy streams, but as these don't require specific degrees either, they're still fairly competitive compared to Statistics, Economics, Social Research, Operational Research, and so on. These other streams often require at least 50% modules in their specific subjects of interest, or in research methods (qualitative/quantitative). If international roles/travel is what you're interested in, note that many government departments have international roles and components to them (i.e. Business and Trade). They are not exclusive to the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO). You may also find the same opportunities in international/global companies. Philosophy is still a great degree in my view, and I'm not trying to discourage you from it, just know that you'll need good backup options if trying for diplomacy or development roles."
Born 2000-2003? Please help!,90,People born September 2002 onwards wonâ€™t be at uni theyâ€™re in year 13
Is it just me or is it easier to get into uni as an international student?,92,"for London unis in particular the offer rate is often considerably higher for international students than home students, so yeah that seems to be the case. bias towards internationals because of those yummy tuition fees"
How does anyone afford to do a Masters?!,71,"Be wealthy, there are some scholarships available but usually they are for masters + PhD afterwards.

The reality is that masters students don't really produce anything so there aren't many people willing to fund them, unless you can get your employer to. And nowadays most masters seem like 1 year graduate visa printers tbh.

This is why I am doing an integrated masters instead so it is all under my undergraduate funding, even though they aren't fully equal (but mostly are in the ways that matter).

Edit: If I want to do a standalone masters I will 100% be doing it in France or Germany, often there are very little to no tuition costs and living costs are far lower than places like London."
Things Have Fallen Apart [Master's],60,"Appreciate the struggle you are going through.

After your experience, do you really think a life in academia is really for you? Its okay for your goals and preferences to change over time so perhaps it might be worth taking a break before attempting a phd."
"I received an offer for Math&amp;Econ at LSE, but my parents donâ€™t think itâ€™s â€˜practicalâ€™ enough. Are they right? ",55,"Assuming this is not a joke post:


Your parents are plain wrong â€“ LSE is an exceptionally famous and highly rated university and you will find that a quantitative degree there (which Maths and Econ definitely is) will open a lot of doors for you. Look at some of their graduate outcomes and you will see that LSE grads tend to do pretty well for themselves.


But on top of that â€“ you are at an age where your parents' advice should not be the deciding factor when making life decisions. They can offer an opinion but that's all it is, and you have every right to disregard it if you choose to do so. 

Unless your parents have some kind of special insight (do they work in the industries you want to go in to? Are they trained careers advisors?) you should take their opinions with a big pinch of salt. It's your degree and your life, not theirs."
Is it better to go to a great university and get a 2.1 or 2.2 or go to a slightly less renowned university and get a 1st?,60,"If youâ€™d have said a 2:1 or a 1st, Iâ€™d 100% go for the 2:1 at a better university

The 2:2 vs the 1st is a trickier one but Iâ€™d go for the 1st, seeing as almost all graduate schemes, Masterâ€™s, PhDâ€™s will want a 2:1 minimum"
How much should I value the Russell Group and/or university rankings?,55,[deleted]
"University of Sussex is the world rank 1 in Development Studies, how much does that realistically mean to employers and how fair is the ranking? (I have an offer from them for a Masters in Conflict, Security and Development, and the course they offer looks really interesting)",51,"I mean realistically, no employer is gonna look at QS and say omg we gotta take the Sussex grad over that Harvard Oxford dual grad ðŸ˜­"
party culture in uni,49,[deleted]
Is it possible to go from low ranking uni at undergrad to a high ranking at masters?,52,"I have supervisors doing PhDs at cambridge who did UG at unis that I've never heard of.

High 1st &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which uni you went to."
Was too afraid to ask.,41,"For IT, the name of your uni probably matters less - what matters is that you are able to demonstrate your skillset and ideally have some internship experience. Depending on what area you want to go into, having a portfolio of your work can also be a good idea."
Is it standard for postgraduate admissions email queries to never receive a response?,38,"Canâ€™t speak for Bristol/UCL, but Iâ€™ve just finished an MSc at LSE. When I was applying they were similarly shite with emails, but if you phoned the department in question youâ€™d get an immediate verbal response and a follow-up to your email normally within the same day. 

This year in particular theyâ€™re obviously extremely busy, but if you give them a ring you should get an answer."
"How come the three London unis KCL, UCL and LSE are ranked in the top five behind Oxbridge for law yet other law schools in the top 10 have more representation in top law firms",40,"London unis are more popular with international students.  Internaitonal students do not place well at top law firms either because they struggle to get visa sponsorship to work in the UK or they return to their home countries to work.

Also if you want to be sinister, unis out of London like durham and bristol etc have a higher intake of private school posh students, as they tend to avoid london. you could argue these posh students are a better fit for top city firms culture wise and so are more successful. I disagree with this point personally but it might have been true 20 years ago, when firms were more elitist and relied more on nepotism.

&amp;#x200B;

Also side note for law when comparing top law unis, most firms do not care about marginal difference, someone at ucl or durham there's little difference in ability and someone at ucl would not be favoured over durham/bristol just cause of its rank, they're all top students. Oxbridge being the exception of course, US firms love them."
Thinking of dropping out due to other people's language barrier,38,"Sadly, a lot of universities see international students as cash cows and pack them in, whether or not they can meaningfully engage. I think outer London unis can be a bit antisocial even as undergraduates (I went to UEL). My guess is that Russell group or more prestigious unis can afford to be a bit more picky with their students. 

My guess (but it is just a guess) is that out of London campus unis are more sociableâ€¦.

Iâ€™m afraid I donâ€™t have solutions for you. I enjoyed my post grad study in Swansea and it was pretty sociable, but since then itâ€™s all been part time whilst working and more recently just online, soâ€¦..

Did you try the student room site to see if thereâ€™s anyone else out there?"
Can you pay back your student loan while still in university?,37,"The biggest factor in the growth of your investments is how early you start so would you not be better investing the money whilst you don't have any responsibilities and have the means to do so? That will easily outgrow what you will be gaining from paying back your student loan early to avoid interest vs just paying it back from your paycheck once you leave.

Also, as u/Mas281 says, you shouldn't make decisions based on what you think you might be earning in 4 years. Say you struggle to find a job or have found one but need a deposit for a place to live, would you rather have the Â£15k in hand (or partially in liquid assets) or have paid off a lot of your student loan but have nowhere to live?

To put it in finance terms, the marginal utility of having a slightly lower student loan payment every month (once you're already making hella bank) is a hell of a lot lower than having a nice block of money behind you coming out of uni/in investments."
Best men's barber for UCL/LSE students?,39,"I go to the London school of Barbering in Carrington, they give free haircuts"
Which University to insure?,39,"What A-levels are you doing?

At a glance, it doesn't really make sense to insure Warwick if you're forming LSE, because the offer is higher in every respect. You'd only get in if they decided to allow you in without meeting your offer, which isn't necessarily a gamble you want to be taking on results day. 

My instinct is to say: put Cardiff as insurance, and then on results day - should you not get into LSE - you have the choice between going to Cardiff this year (or anywhere through clearing that'll take you) or taking a gap year and applying to Warwick/somewhere better than Cardiff for the next application cycle with results in hand. You'd do that by asking Cardiff to release your place. If you insured Warwick, if you didn't meet your LSE offer on results day, you'd be at the mercy of their admissions team + clearing meaning there's a reasonable chance you wouldn't be able to go to uni that year. 

I'm not necessarily an expert though, so do discuss this with your teachers; they'll have advised thousands of students before you on how to assign UCAS choices."
Should I apply the uni again in fall?,25,"I personally came across this issue before I came to uni. I received what I call 'disappointing' results, took a year out, resat my exams (a levels) and got my place at university.

A gap year used like this can be really useful for interviews for graduate jobs too as it shows traits which employers like etc. And so I think its worth it.

A friend of mine faced similar issues and resolved to attend a polytechnic (Liverpool John Moores) then transferred after achieveing an excellent grade to the University of Liverpool. He since went on to master at UCL.

The main difference is that he graduated a year before me, and so has been working for a year longer than me.

The most important thing is that you go with the choice that is best for you. I found that the year out really helped me decide what I wanted to do with my life, whereas my friend used his masters to change his career path after 3 years of engineering to do economics.

Also ""mature"" students, which are those which have taken time out, can be seen as favourable as they're more focused on work and less likely to drop out... etc. Although this is different for each university. 

It may be worth contacting the school within UCL/LSE to see if taking a year out will affect your chances. It can also give you a point of contact for asking any further questions."
