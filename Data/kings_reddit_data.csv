I regret my undergrad uni choice,188,"That was rude, but I think lots of academics wouldn't be mega interested in 'networking' with undergrads anyway. You don't have any work to talk about yet. Just feels like free teaching"
University subreddits,188,"/r/Edinburgh_University Edinburgh, University of"
Gap year worth it?,118,"A year out for UCL/KCL/Bristol maybe not. You'd get better connections, opportunities with firms etc, so it's definitely better. Cambridge it would be. A\*A\*A\* is great but obviously no guarantee that you'll get in to Camb, as other applicants have a similar profile.

Did you do LNAT this year? How it go?"
Should I switch to QMUL from Warwick to get a free degree,72,I would go to uni in a cave if they were gonna give me a free degree
King's College vs University of Glasgow,60,"Both are very prestigious universities. I wouldn‚Äôt care so much about university rankings. Glasgow‚Äôs tuition is cheaper, you won‚Äôt have to retake the TOEFL, and you‚Äôll be getting a ¬£10000 scholarship. Personally I think Glasgow is the better option. Still a nice city with plenty of things to do, but not as busy and expensive as London. Prestigious university, and the program is one you want."
my sister is going to Cambridge. just wanted to ask some questions,63,"As a general reassurance, I overall felt that History in general at Cambridge had less academic pressure than other subjects as it was a less intense course. I will caveat this with the fact that while you get used to university life, it really might not feel like this in the first term and there is still some pressure there!

If she is able to manage her time well, it also has a much more consistent workload and deadlines with the bulk of the work being one essay per week. History students are often heavily involved in a lot of societies because they have the free time to be. It‚Äôs also generally pretty hard to not get a 2:1 or higher in History (just check the uni stats), which I always found quite reassuring!  

My advice would be:
- Learn to read ‚Äòsmart‚Äô - she will get a booklist containing a lot of material, but doesn‚Äôt need to read it all; find reviews of academic work for a summary, read the intro/conclusion and specific sections of chapters. 
- Make life easy by always footnoting! It helps with revision and is good practice for coursework.
- Focus time on learning how she learns best. I learnt best from reading lots, and saved time by not attending a lot of lectures - that‚Äôs what worked for me, but she might find it quicker to learn lots from the lectures and use the reading to supplement her understanding. 
- After the first couple of terms, reflect on the papers she‚Äôs taking. Which does she find easiest, and why? Choose more like that, where possible - it saves time and you are more likely to do well if you take papers that work with your learning style! (e.g. I preferred papers with a more limited scope that have a lot of depth, she might prefer papers that allow a broader philosophical discussion). 
- Ask for help - the collegiate environment is great for introducing you to students in different year groups, and older students can help by providing notes, advice and general essay support, and previous sample work etc.
- Speak to her tutor if things get overwhelming; if she gets on well with hers, they‚Äôre a great resource at helping you if things are a little bit too much.
- I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but try not to buy into the pressure. Some other students might be competitive (even unintentionally) and increase the pressure but, where possible, work collaboratively and support each other rather than comparing scores/grades/essay feedback. Similarly, some supervisors and Directors of Study have different standards that they expect of students and although feedback is very valuable, sometimes you have to take things with a pinch of salt (e.g. just because they worked 90 hour weeks, got a double starred first etc, does not mean they‚Äôre representative or that your sister should be doing that much!)
- Enjoy Cambridge! It‚Äôs a beautiful city with so much to do and so many exciting things happening - there are so many societies to get involved in, and the College system is great for making friends across a variety of subjects. If she has a work-life balance, things are definitely a lot easier (plus great CV points for post-uni life). 

In terms of what you can do to help her, just be there for her! It sounds like you‚Äôre already really supportive, which is lovely. You could maybe support by doing things like helping her break down any work she‚Äôs overwhelmed by into manageable bits, listen to general ranting, and bringing her a cup of tea during the inevitable holiday work? 

Wishing her all the best and feel free to DM if you have any specific questions"
Pick my uni!!,58,Manchester airport is really handy for getting to Europe and the cost of living in Manchester is much lower than London. You can also get a train to Birmingham then London so it‚Äôs easy to travel around the UK too.
How much should I value the Russell Group and/or university rankings?,56,[deleted]
Might have just missed out on halls (Glasgow uni),44,"No one here can really answer that. 

Hopefully you can, if not they often to wait lists and you might be able to get onto that. After results day rooms may open up. 

You can go through private halls not Uni managed halls and you can get the experience that way."
what's with the hate against KCL by those who don't even study there?,45,The student room hate anything thats not oxford or cambridge most often.
Submitted UCAS on the 15th of Jan- how long till I get a decision? - Not to be impatient or anything.. just curious :P,35,"As all three of them are Russell Group universities, so they‚Äôll take longer to respond than most. They‚Äôre only required to give you a decision by May so expect to receive word at around mid to late April. But it could be earlier so don‚Äôt let your hopes down!"
A Little Rant About The IB (And How It Affected My Chances of going to King's College London),27,"Don't worry about it, if kings have already dropped to 33, 666 then there is a good chance you'll get in post a level results. KCL has been struggling for the last few years and has been in clearing. "
"Is Oxford, LSE, Imperial, Warwick, and then Kings as my absolute safety a bit too risky? I‚Äôd be applying for an Economics related degree at all of them.",25,"Lol yes. King‚Äôs isn‚Äôt super highly ranked for econ, but to call it an absolute safety is stupid. It‚Äôs a top university in London that gets many more applications than places."

Is it possible to apply for different degrees to UK universities as opposed to only one?,21,"What your counsellor is saying is wrong but has some truth.

You can apply for whichever degrees you like - there's nothing stopping you from eg. applying for maths for 4/5 choices and, say, law for your 5th. 

*However* when you apply you can only submit one personal statement for all your applications. If you're applying for degrees that are different, it's going to be difficult to cater your PS to all of those degrees. If you think you can reasonably write a personal statement for both law and econ, world's your oyster."

Is there any university rankings that can be reliably depended on,18,Bro go to bed it‚Äôs like 4
Which university should I choose?,17,"University of Bath, despite not being a member of the Russell Group, is excellent. I would choose that one, considering everything."
Being discouraged from applying to St. Andrews. Advice/experience on what the uni is actually like?,15,"Very old traditional uni with loads of weird quirks. Nice beach and great if you love golf. It is very small and most of the people who live in st andrews are uni students. Not many scottish people actually live there.

Great for sports and societies though and americans."

What's King's College London like as a Uni?,15,"I'm an offer holder for KCL and I'll most likely be insuring it. 

I think social life depends mainly on you but if you go to uni in London there is usually always something to do since everything is basically at your doorstep so, there isn't much to worry about in that department. But I will say that various people have complained about the living costs of a big city and the lack of campus atmosphere as the faculties are pretty much spread out across London. If you are someone who likes the hustle of a city and can afford it then it's for you.

I'm not sure about lecturers because I obviously don't attend there but it probably varies by department. Have a look at the subject rankings. From what I know, KCL excels in law, politics, history etc. 

If you choose to firm KCL then they direct you to apply for accommodation. You can look at all the different halls on their website."

Uni advice for an international student?,12,"I'd cross off Kent, East Anglia and Reading from that list in terms of general reputation.

What is it about St Andrews' location that you like? "
Kings vs Bath for economics at kings my program is economics with management and a year in industry and at Bath my program is economics with a year in industry which is better?,12,"Bath by far. I really struggle to understand why people think kings is any good. Constantly abysmal for student satisfaction in all uk rankings, Bath also has much stronger graduate career outcomes. Rankings aren‚Äôt everything sure, but pretty much across the board for the last 5 years on British rankings, Bath blows kings out of the water. Internationals flock to kings for some unfathomable reason, likley bc on world rankings like qs which are very hit and miss and pretty much only take into account name and research quality, not other important factors like career outcomes and student satisfaction, kings appears to be very good. In the uk I don‚Äôt think many British students overrate it as much as internationals do."
how does anybody pay for uni?,13,[deleted]
Changing courses,12,[deleted]
üç™here's a cookie: help am international student. PLEASE.,12,"1. All the equivalents will be listed on the university website so you can reference them there. If in doubt ask the university, but it should be there.   

2. You don't lose much by taking it, just submit the score and application anyway. Even if you get rejected from Cambridge if it's not the institution you have your sights on you don't lose anything, if you get accepted there it's something to brag about.   

3. This and 4 are kind of the same question so I combined them as 3. You have a lot going for you already so that's good, they want to know you'd be worth teaching, how intellectually curious you are, what excites you academically. Write about that and what interests you about the universities you're applying for, the course, etc. LSE is an extremely competitive university with a lot of applicants but nothing is impossible. Be a student that makes them excited to teach you, show them how you want to develop by studying there.   

4. Kings, St Andrews and Warwick are all top universities in many fields, the decision comes down to more where you want to live, what sort of things you're looking for in a university. I'd recommend researching each school and the subjects that interest you, a tour may be difficult flying in from India just for that but if you could combine it with a trip then it will help a lot in getting a feel for a place.   

5. There are racist people in every country, universities are very liberal as far as accepting race and culture so not much to worry about there. Indians make up a large part of the student body in many universities so you'll hardly be unique to the campus, nor a city like London which is a melting pot of cultures. There are international students in London from all walks of life, societies for just about every country with major representation on campus, faith societies, academic societies, hobbies, so you'll find friends quite easily if you take advantage of what is there. After being in London for a year I think it's a great place to live, always something happening, because of the cultural mix you can find every kind of food, music, faith and everything else. London universities have strong connections so many student halls, clubs and societies allow you to meet people from all the different universities and find people who share your interests."
