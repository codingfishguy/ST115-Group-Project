Do you agree with the 2024 Completeuniguide rankings?,1063,These are so pointless‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs entirely dependent on the course and the individual.
Anyone else feel like the uni system is a bit unfair?,286,"If you got rejected from Bristol with 4 A* predicted then your PS was a weak part of your application. Your got amazing grades, I think you should have taken a gap year to reapply and fill in the time with work/personal development. Most likely you would have had strong chance at top uni this time around."
My dad won't let me choose my University,264,"He doesn‚Äôt control your student loan, you do. In fact, the tuition itself isn‚Äôt even in your control, it goes straight to the university, it‚Äôs only the maintenance loan that you‚Äôll get regardless of the uni you go to that you control."
How do I let go being rejected when it was my fault?,240,"Chalk it down to a lack of experience, learn from it and move on."
"For the North Americans, was going to uni in UK a big shock?",215,"I mean, 8 week semesters is an Oxbridge thing really, most UK universities have a more manageable 11"
TIL some unis have worse graduate prospects than non-graduates,203,"I think people should bear in mind that Imperial only offers STEM and LSE focuses a lot of financial careers. That inflates the average salaries. In reality, the top 4 are very similar."

"I realise beyond the very top, differences in university rankings are so negligible",114,I love how much this sub obsesses over rankings
Dropping out of Imperial to go to Newcastle Uni?,93,"Newcastle is still a great uni and city, but Imperial will be significantly better for some career prospects. What are you hoping to do after your degree? 

At the same time though, if you‚Äôre really really unhappy with imperial, and think you‚Äôd be happier at Newcastle then absolutely do what‚Äôs best for you. A 1st from Ncl is better than failing at `imperial because you were depressed."
Should I switch to QMUL from Warwick to get a free degree,73,I would go to uni in a cave if they were gonna give me a free degree
Would you say uni of surrey is worth the international fees? I‚Äôve heard people say if you‚Äôre not going oxbridge or imperial it‚Äôs not worth it but i don‚Äôt think they understand the value of any foreign degree in some other countries.,68,"People say that because overseas fees in the UK are extortionate. To justify it, you really should be targeting a top HEI or you might be better served in your home country.

Of course, nuances apply. Perhaps in your field of work a foreign degree is appreciated. In that case you should check Surrey's reputation for your degree course and field."
"Imperial College Physics? Marking Boycott, think again",63,"The marking boycott is everywhere, really. Atrocious where I am as well. Sorry about this, OP."
Received an increased offer at Imperial College London,56,Did you have an interview with them? From what I know their leniency is dependant on the interview. This is coming from someone who bombed their imperial physics interview üòÇ
Is Imperial College London really worth the price tag?,56,"UK unis really milk the international student cash cow, especially Asians where university prestige pervades every aspect of life. If you're aiming to do PhD afterwards I'd suggest that you do it in your home country where it's probably much cheaper, get excellent marks, then apply to UK unis for PhD funding. 

As an anecdote: I applied to Imperial but the department was more keen about my funding details than my research proposal. I believe Imperial is a great uni but as a poor Asian student I absolutely couldn't imagine racking up debt just because I want to go to a global Top 10 uni when I can get a scholarship to study for free in a Top 20 uni."
Is it better to go to a great university and get a 2.1 or 2.2 or go to a slightly less renowned university and get a 1st?,57,"If you‚Äôd have said a 2:1 or a 1st, I‚Äôd 100% go for the 2:1 at a better university

The 2:2 vs the 1st is a trickier one but I‚Äôd go for the 1st, seeing as almost all graduate schemes, Master‚Äôs, PhD‚Äôs will want a 2:1 minimum"
Living costs Oxford university VS London (imperial) vs Warwick university,53,"London and Oxford are both expensive cities to live in. For Warwick, you're really living in Coventry, so the costs are a lot lower.

You can eat cheaply in all three places, so long as you don't expect to live on canteen food, takeaways and ready meals. Some of the Oxford colleges heavily subsidise their food as well."
At which rank uni does the mindset change?,44,"Some people recognise at a younger age (&lt;18) that theres nothing wrong about being enthusiastic and enjoying studying subjects. They tend to do more work and get better grades then those who enjoy mucking about instead. You then get a pretty clear separation of people when they go to Uni.

I'd guess it gradual, with more keenos the higher up the ranks you go - rather than a cut off somewhere."
"how reliable are the qs rankings?Glasgow is ranked very highly in the accounts/finance in the ranking.asking this as I have an offer from Exeter,bath and Glasgow so far,waiting the decision from the other big boys.https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2022/a",39,"The link you sent is primarily for undergraduate courses, I wouldn‚Äôt try to infer the quality of postgraduate courses from it.

Much of the data is gotten from student surveys, so it‚Äôs not super reliable and you definitely can‚Äôt just attach a number to student experience and course quality, especially when most people experience just one uni and have no point of comparison with any others.

I‚Äôd recommend making your decision on course content that you like, the location and costs associated, graduate prospects from the courses, and any additional unique benefits to studying there. 

I‚Äôd prioritise graduate prospects the least here because it‚Äôs honestly highly dependent on the students themselves rather than the course, you can go to a ‚Äúbad‚Äù uni and still ace the course and get internship experience, make a great resume/CV, and get a super nice graduate job at the end."
Is Saint Andrews as bad as it sounds?,36,"That‚Äôs not ‚Äòbad‚Äô, it‚Äôs just its own vibe. Many people will love it. But if it‚Äôs not your thing then there are plenty of great unis with better nightlife.

Have you been able to visit anywhere?"
Spotify student for UK unis?,36,Just message spotify help on their live chat and they'll help you sort it
Imperial College London Materials Science AVOID!!!!!,34,Can you explain why your experience was bad?
What are the cons of going to imperial college I‚Äôve managed to convince them of why I don‚Äôt like the other unis in London but I need a reason to tell my parents why I don‚Äôt want to go there I can‚Äôt stay home for uni üò≠,35,It's expensive
Submitted UCAS on the 15th of Jan- how long till I get a decision? - Not to be impatient or anything.. just curious :P,38,"As all three of them are Russell Group universities, so they‚Äôll take longer to respond than most. They‚Äôre only required to give you a decision by May so expect to receive word at around mid to late April. But it could be earlier so don‚Äôt let your hopes down!"
Education quality difference between universities?,33,"Massively. 

I recruit grads, and honestly some universities give a degree to anyone who‚Äôs willing to sign the check.

This doesn‚Äôt mean only RG/oxbridge has any worth, far from it. But there are a number of glorified diploma mills in the UK with toilet level entry requirements who will take anyone with a pulse and have a vested interest in taking more students.

People who are any good from those unis are good DESPITE the education they received not BECAUSE of it. They‚Äôre the exception.

A personal example for me is university of Westminster. I‚Äôve had graduates in life sciences who can‚Äôt even type coherently let alone use a pipette. I watched one literally put the pipette in their mouth to remove the top as it was stuck, I actually screamed I was so shocked. I have literally never had a single grad from that sess pool that had more education than the average school leaver at 16-18. We mostly get them through agency work and it would be easier to train my dad to do entry level lab work as a man with no education than it is to train some of these people, it‚Äôs crazy. They couldn‚Äôt even coherently discuss their own dissertations. I‚Äôd love to read one because I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs total bullshit but they just pass anyone. 

I would never take a Uni of Westminster grad unless they had work experience because so many of them are worse than picking up a random person from the street, yet apparently they have a ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in lab based science. It‚Äôs insane. I recruit for one of the universities you list and in general grads from my own uni are on average exceptional, but I‚Äôve obviously had a few who were only average (but never completely useless). (And full disclosure I manage students doing their BMedSci year so I have a lot of exposure to my unis students but I do not teach). 

So in general a mid tier uni isn‚Äôt much worse than a prestigious one, but be aware there are very shit diploma mills preying on students and internationals to make money who provide close to no education value. My best employee came from a mid tier uni and she is absolutely astounding and has gone on post phd to be a leader in her field.

Also not all unis are the same for all subjects, some can be amazing for say science but a degree in another subject is bad. Many mid tier or lower unis can be outstanding in their niche and for other subjects are pretty meh. There‚Äôs no one size fits all outside of top unis.

You are what you make of your education. I‚Äôve had Oxford grads who were pretty average and mid tier uni grads who were exceptional. Your degree doesn‚Äôt define you but there are very shit unis who offer 0 value for money taking the piss.

You‚Äôll be just as successful at a top 50% uni as you will be at a top 1% so long as you have the skills passion and drive. But avoid bottom 10-20% as they‚Äôre not even worth the fees"
Can't help but feel disappointed in myself,35,"The uni you go to doesn't matter as much as people think it does. I had a couple friends that did CS and said while they were doing their degrees that they'd rather have been at one of the top unis in London, but once they graduated they still found good jobs in London and are both now on over 50k 3 years after we graduated"
Is it true that one-year MSc program is hard to get a job with?,32,"One-year masters are the norm in the UK, unless Immunoglogy is for some reason different. 

So if you are applying for jobs in the UK the people who you are going to be competing against  - most likely - are going to have a one-year masters. 

So it shouldn't be an issue."
Imperial College London leaders admit they bullied colleagues,26,I want to know what they said
Delivery mode for next autumm,26,"I'm employed by a university. We are currently planning on in-person teaching by default, with remote options as a ""just in case"" fallback that we aren't putting too much work into."
"Is Oxford, LSE, Imperial, Warwick, and then Kings as my absolute safety a bit too risky? I‚Äôd be applying for an Economics related degree at all of them.",25,"Lol yes. King‚Äôs isn‚Äôt super highly ranked for econ, but to call it an absolute safety is stupid. It‚Äôs a top university in London that gets many more applications than places."
How are you taking notes in University????? iPad for notes taking?,27,I use pen and paper but fuck me I wish I had an ipad
