Is anyone completely disengaged with university to the point of not attending any lectures/tutorials and only looking at that when it's needed for assignments/exams? I cannot focus with online learning at all and don't even feel like a student,460,[deleted]
"Apparently alot of ""covid"" student have been dropping out of Uni",385,"I'm an admissions tutor and lecturer. I teach a fairly challenging module but it's actually quite popular and the final average was about 65%. During Covid we went to online assessment, which resulted in the average shooting up. We returned to a proctored exam last year, and the the average was 38%. This was the 2021 intake (its a Year 2 module). A lot have failed other modules so will be deregistered. Some have quit before they are pushed. Its absolutely not their fault and it's really sad. Their A-levels were severely interrupted, they never learnt how to study properly, and they were totally demoralised. Unfortunately, I think the government will just forget about them. I worry they'll become a lost cohort like the Japanese kids who graduated during the Pacific financial crisis."
Important: For people starting uni this year.,378,"Also, not just for you but fellow students, we appreciate there being fewer people to spread whatever arrives on campus."
who'd had thunk it,372,Some of us also seem to make this face upon discovering hangovers.
Has anyone done a degree they now realise has absolutely no job prospects?,363,What was your undergraduate degree?
I wasted my fucking time at uni and now I regret ever even going,345,It wasn‚Äôt Uni - it was the time and situation. Feel for you mate and hope you sort it out.
We need student unions to act now more than ever,338,All we get from our SU is a ‚Äúgood luck for exams‚Äù email üôÉ
Please don't waste your social life at uni like I did,309,[deleted]
Finished a whole year of uni without making a single friend,299,Societies. There are plenty that have activities that you can talk about which lessened the awkwardness quite a bit
"Today I sat through a 1 hour lecture on Aerospace Engineering because I got the wrong room (I do CompSci), I then had a practical in which one of my peers tried to convince me the covid vaccine doesn't work throughout the whole thing. How was your day?",268,"Had my first lecture for a new module and the people behind me wouldn't shut the fuck up for the whole lecture, genuinely wanted to murder them by the end &gt;:("
"To the people who started Uni in 2019 like me, does it feel like it was a million years ago?",256,"It feels like a different reality. The whole world and my entire life got upended, and everything I had planned for how the next few years of my life would look like was just totally destroyed.

Feels like I just drifted through a degree and the past few years because it sure as hell wasn't like any university experience I had envisioned and nothing anyone else had or would experience either."
I hate university (rant),253,"You need to talk to someone about how unhappy you are. You sound like you are really depressed and you need some help. I'm sorry university has been so disappointing for you, I'm not going to tell you that it's ok, because it's not. University should be something you enjoy, not feel so awful about. You are not without options, but they are going to be very difficult to see when you feel so low. Please - stop drinking (self-medication is rarely a good idea), start attending again or at least talk to your tutor about how unhappy you are. Take care of yourself"
I wasted my years at Uni and feel utterly depressed.,224,"yeah people who had their uni years during covid missed out on the social aspect of it, so I'm sorry for you in that regard however I just wanted to comment on the uni being the best years of your life part.

&amp;#x200B;

This sounds insanely depressing if you spend some time to think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people go to uni between 18 and 21, maybe you took a gap year, changed course  and did a masters, that still means you graduate at 25 at the latest. So you are telling me I'm going to live 50 more years (possibly more, yikes) and my best days are already behind me?

That sounds horrible to me personally. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's always plenty of time to create new memories, and I always like to think the best times of my life are still ahead, otherwise life becomes kinda depressing."
Reimburse all students of this year‚Äôs fees due to strikes and COVID-19,222,More chance of me finding the corona vaccine up my arse hole than this happening.
"I moved to uni just over a week ago, and here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs been!",213,"I've seen a lot of negative posts here, so hopefully someone sharing a positive experience like you will help some people out. It's definitely eased my nerves reading this, as I'm due to leave later on this week, and a lot of the other freshers posts were super, super negative and made me feel a bit apprehensive. Thanks for sharing!"
"Students who studied during the years of the Covid Lockdowns, do you feel you were disadvantaged?",207,"This brings out a mix of emotions, if I‚Äôm honest. I started university in 2019; taught in-person for five months, then taught online for nineteen months ‚Äî went from someone who hadn‚Äôt even had half of their first year to a third year, all in a flash.

I took this period in two ways. Personally, I enjoyed it. It enabled me to catch-up and adjust to university. By my second year, when everything was open other than the university itself, I was flying. However, from a teaching/social standpoint, it was dire. Lecturers didn‚Äôt get a true grasp on how to effectively use zoom, etc, till the very end. I had one lecturer who taught entirely on mute ‚Äî he didn‚Äôt understand how to share his screen, so utilised a 3mp laptop camera projected on a home whiteboard. Socially, the two years were isolating but also refreshing: I came out of the period a changed person, dumped many negative people, and started from new."
Covid: Students call for day of action over fees,197,"‚ÄúWomen, why are you fighting for your right to vote? Stop crying over it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBlack people, don‚Äôt bother fighting for your civil rights - you‚Äôre never gonna get them from a white government.‚Äù

‚ÄúQueer people, I wish you got right to marry but I just don‚Äôt see it happening with this political climate. Sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúCovid students, if you think unis will slash their profits in half, you‚Äôre dead wrong.‚Äù


Everyone with these arguments, please shut the fuck up. Stop giving arguments for why slashing fees can‚Äôt happen - you are giving your voice to the people who are imposing these ridiculous tuition fees. It‚Äôs the equivalent of the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not racist but...‚Äù thing. 

If some Reddit apes can crash the stock market, student tuition fees won‚Äôt be a problem."
Anyone else here worried that Universities will backtrack on the 'blended learning' strategy and shift back to all online in the event the COVID situation gets worse ?,190,I work for a University and we‚Äôre now planning on no blended learning and going completely face to face (all public announcements say blended learning so they‚Äôre waiting until closer to September to announce in case they have to U turn). Online learning costs the uni a lot more to run then face to face and they want to avoid as much as possible.
"Guys, I seriously screwed up by wasting my effing time at uni. I honestly regret even bothering to go now. Anyone else feeling the same way?",182,Yep and I came out with a 2:2. :(
Covid life hack that will change your life,170,"I barely even watch the prerecorded stuff anymore. Usually just go through the lecture slides and take notes, if there's anything I don't understand from it I skip through to that part of the recording. Saved so much time"
I know this strays from the norm here but I am so fucking excited to go Uni in September!,162,"Damn, I haven't had your kind of enthusiasm since I was 10, good for you, mate"
Dissertation completed in 3 days,164,That is fantastic news. It must be such a relief that it is finally over with.
Is anyone worried about covid restrictions easing?,156,"As an international student currently in the UK,  I'm also very worried as the possible (but honestly it's probably gonna happen) skyrocket in cases could force the UK to go intoANOTHER national lockdown and/or force my home country to ban all flights to and from the UK.

The promise and commitment to easing the covid restrictions completely is, I think, a very not good idea but BoJo and co. are going through with it."
How to cope with bad flatmates,150,Think you've dodged a bullet there not getting a house with them ngl
Anyone else struggling with university?,149,"I'm torn.

On the one hand, I like my course, and I've met a few close friends. My flat are nice enough, but bar two of them they're definitely people I'd see as acquaintances rather than friends. University isn't therefore that exciting, but I'm holding out for 3rd term and 2/3rd years."
I don‚Äôt have friends and I don‚Äôt know what to do,147,"I feel for you, lockdown uni isn't conducive to meeting lots of people. In no particular order here are some suggestions:

Join a society. If you feel like it's too late for that or you're not into any, then ask yourself if you're maybe just talking yourself out of it. Individuals are experts at self sabotage.

If you still don't want to join one then join interests outside of uni. Local judo club / book club / ukulele / birdwatching / bouldering etc. At the very least you'll gain new skills and pass the time doing something rewarding with people.

Get a bar job, fib about your experience. I had a friend who would do this alongside his normal day job to meet different people.

Consider reading some books on the topic of friendship. It might help you see things differently. Self help reading has way too much stigma around it, why wouldn't you help yourself!?

Consider if the falling out you had with these friends that you did have is irreconcilable. If it's a misunderstanding or a simple olive branch gesture might get this back on track then swallow your pride.

If you're still living privately, try and go into a house share. Not sure if you have any break clause with your current accommodation. Shaking up my living situation helped me as a graduate.

Dating apps, you can use these for friendships if you're up front about it in your profile. And obvs you can use them in the way they are intended too. Be safe about it.

Join your course mates on some drinks/coffee if they go out for them, they might not be as different as you think. Refer back to my point re self sabotage.

Look at couchsurfing.org for your town, they likely have weekly meet ups, you don't have to host anyone to use it.

In the same vein hostel bars might work - almost every traveller outside of a couple is open to meet people.

You could also look at deferring your term after Xmas to do some hostel travel and inter railing yourself.

My dad told me the friends you make at uni are the ones you keep for life. I can categorically say that isn't the case for me. So if you have ever been told similar don't sweat it, there's plenty of time!"
My parents are embarrassed,141,"Take the time you need to do things the right way. It's far better to graduate later with better prospects than graduate early but off the wrong foot and stuck in a careers rut for years if not forever. Don't compare yourself to other people. Compare yourself to yourself based on different options. What would it be like for *you* if you graduated early compared to if *you* take a placement year?

Are your parents asian? Disregard the peer pressure/shame aspect that belongs in the last century. That approach would prefer you to have ticked every 'box' and then live a miserable life than take an unorthodox pathway. (and a placement year is hardly unorthodox)"
Rant: God next academic year is going to be a clusterfuck &gt;:(,139,"Yep, this is an absolute shit position to be in right now. Which is why I'm taking a year out and working, hopefully when I come back it'll be less shit and I'll get my year abroad place back."
Anyone else depressed that their last year of uni is going to be shit?,140,"I mean, life is full of regrets, try to minimise them in reality by learning - eg actually go out more when this is over."
This year of uni fucked me up,136,This. Anybody having to retake this year certainly has nothing to be ashamed about.
I got 80 in a third-year 3k word essay that I typed up the day before the deadline‚Ä¶,135,"Whilst I wouldn't reccomend it, writing an essay last minute means it is pretty difficult to overthink/over complicate it."
Do not do professional policing at university - it is not worth it.,130,Whoever came up with that course needs locking up.
University of Liverpool cancels all face-to-face teaching for the rest of the academic year due to COVID-19,129,"üéâüéâ 
Still very in the dark about the nature of exams we will be having, and honestly everything else. But that's understandable at this point and hopefully come Monday there will be more clarity."
Absolutely wasted first year and second year,122,"Hey OP,

I was in a similar situation to you at the end of last year, terrible anxiety and overthinking leading to me having no social life over the first two years, and was convinced this year would be the same. This year has been the best year of my life by far and I promise you that it can be the case for you, though you'll have to force yourself out of your comfort zone.

I highly highly recommend joining a sports club, or at the very least, a non-academic society. Are there any sports you've wanted to try before (or at least like the sound of) that you could give a go? Most unis run taster sessions for their sports clubs to let people give new things a try at the start of the academic year. Not only will you meet people there, but they'll probably also run social events/drinking nights too. You'll have to force yourself to do these things, and if you're like me you probably won't be comfortable with it at first, but if it goes poorly you'll never have to see these people again."
A sense of worthlessness at uni (first year),122,"Same. I think because of covid I've only really had a chance to speak to people on my course, and apart from one person, I haven't really got on with any of them. But then again, even if there was a freshers I don't think I would've engaged with it properly.Reading this made me think whether I should ask this person if they want to hang out because I've been debating it for a couple days but didn't want to come across as a beg or annoying.  There's still time, but your social life won't be dead if you don't manage to make any good friends at uni."
Anyone else have a cough that just won't fuck off?,118,"Fresher's flu appears to have got you. Lots of people in my residence have the horrific cough along with other cold-like symptoms, though I appear to have the worst cough in the flat. I'd stay off smoking anything at all while you have this cough and maybe even a bit afterwards in case it gets set off again."
Universities are losing a lot of money due to COVID.,111,"I‚Äôm a PhD at Newcastle and any spending on internal accounts now has to be approved by your Head of School, anything over ¬£1000 is also approved by a University board; external grant money has no spending freeze. 

We‚Äôve also seen staff on temp rolling contracts in some Schools not be renewed and any promotions this year are in name only with the pay increase coming in 2021. Student bursaries etc have thankfully not been impacted. 

It‚Äôs hard to find exact numbers but I‚Äôve heard that the University are expecting a shortfall of as much as ¬£100million from both international and UK students either choosing to defer or, in the case of internationals, not being able to get their visas even if they want to come as consulates are closed. Add on to that a potential lack of EU students from next year due to changes in funding and the sector is really going to struggle."
I feel so helpless and alone,116,"Hey! I study at Manchester too but I‚Äôm not a fresher. Is your flat in Fallowfield? I‚Äôd be happy to go and get your favourite snack or drink from the store for you or something :) 

Also are you into online games? The uni has just opened a minecraft society and it could be a good way for you to pass the time"
talking about having no friends...,110,"Joining a society sounds great! It might take a bit of work to figure out the right ones for you, but you can make friends (or atleast get your fill of socialising) through them.

I found first year a bit lonely, even as an older student who is used to having few friends, and who did have a couple of close acquaintances they made. It's super hard, so I don't blame you and others for feeling like this. And yeah as you say, even harder with covid.

As for housing, you might have to start keeping an eye out for housing events and news that where students are looking for others, or the sessions they run where students can meet other students, etc. Do be proactive in it, but don't let it stress you out just yet. You have time. Regarding friends, yeah. It definitely is difficult. All I can say there too is to make sure you get involved in things and make your face known in chats and stuff. Obviously don't force yourself into situations, but I think everyone is feeling that anxiousness of wanting to make friends, but we all display it differently. So don't get put off by the more confident people in your year, they probably have their own versions of these issues.

Maybe others can offer advice too, but I generally think you just need to throw yourself at a few more things (like you sound like you will), stay confident in yourself, and be totally okay with the very natural feelings of wanting to socialise and make friends. Many of us felt that way in first year, so you should take pride in recognising that aspect of your health and how you want to do something about it."
Word of advice for freshers,115,You guys are peaking in freshers? üò≥
"1st year at uni, worried about COVID + loneliness.",110,Is your first semester teaching going to be online? Also how far is your university from your home? If you are seriously worried then just go home and wait a bit for things to calm down.
Anyone else‚Äôs Uni course doesn‚Äôt care about seminar attendance?,110,"As far as I'm aware, recording the attendance is both a safeguarding measurement and to cover the uni's back.

I had a friend who wasn't interacting with the online learning space at all (this was in lockdown) and he received an email just asking him if he needed any help accessing the learning space and saying that the majority of students need to access it more frequently to succeed on the course.

This was because, if he had failed, he couldn't submit a formal complaint saying he never received any help or was never made aware of the expectations needed to pass.

It may very well be the same situation for your seminar attendance tracking."
My degree mark doesn‚Äôt match my classification,109,Take it and run
Dropping out in third year,107,"Please don‚Äôt drop out, you are so close to the finish line. It‚Äôs like 7 months until you finish this course. You won‚Äôt be able to do another course if you drop out, as you only get funding for 4 years. 

I literally felt the same as you, I am sorry for your loss. Have you thought of joining societies or a sports club, they are great for making friends. 

If you drop out what will you do?? This degree will give you great employability skills and will help open doors.  

You are so close, you can literally see the light at the end of the tunnel. Just a final push and you have completed this degree."
Daughter wants to drop out,103,"Hey,

I was a young 'old soul', I'm a mature student and a parent, so feel like I can offer some perspective here.

That is to say, there is no right path. 
I didn't go to Uni when my friends went, I wasn't academic. I worked a bunch of different jobs, gained life experience, saved, travelled, found a sector I liked, worked my way up a bit, got married and had kids. 

Decided to give education another bash and give myself a chance at progressing further and making a bit more cash. I'm having a great uni experience now I can live in my old soul and no one expects that I'll stay out to party. Its all about the work for me. I'm on placement too, as well as working, and being a mother, and I find my life experience and the skill set I've acquired over my working life so far means I'm able to cope with adversity and juggle these things. 

Your daughter will find her way, and a degree will always be there for her to take when she wants to take it. 

It's fair to tell her she has to be *doing* something, but then let her lead."
Moving to uni in a few days - any advice for a jittery international student?,100,"If your country uses different plug sockets than the UK, don‚Äôt forget to bring plenty of plug adapters. It‚Äôll make your life a lot easier.

I‚Äôm an international student who‚Äôs been in the UK for a while, so if you have any specific questions feel free to DM me :)"
Are my uni allowed to do this? They're saying I can't finish my degree without doing 120 extra placement hours which wasn't communicated to me during my course.,101,"You need to speak to the student union about the specifics; if its a requirement, then you'll have to but can request additional support or resources in regards to compensating you for the lack of communication.

If you've already received your degree, write back and ask for details on where you're lacking credits and you should anyway be able to arrange a date on your own time. 

You may be able to do it in a few years; if you've already got your job, it's unlikely they're now going to fire you, because your university fucked up and didnt realise you didn't complete a requirement. 

Youve been trained and have shown youre more than competent for the role. 

The key is communication. Contact the Head of education for your school, as well as the student support office if youre able to. You should be able to find these on the uni website about staff, but if you email and ask for the people, they'll tell you; heck, phoning up would get you the names pretty quickly. But it is a weekend now :( 

I'm glad some good could came from my insomniac ass scrolling through reddit in bed. Lmk if you have any questions; im sure others will see this in a few hours so you should have some answers for when you wake up."
Government set to cap university admissions amid Covid-19 chaos | The Guardian,101,"&gt; It also means some students will not be able to attend universities at which they have been offered place.

I wonder how this would work? I was under the impression that a university offer is almost like a legal contract, although a quick google tells me it's more complex than that and there's probably some loophole which would allow universities to do this. Still though, sounds incredibly unfair.

Another thing I was thinking about - imagine you're a student with AAA predicted grades, but based on your teachers' evaluations and mock grades you are awarded something like AAB, causing you to miss out on your university place. I can't imagine the frustration at that decision being entirely out of your hands. It creates a horrible scenario for teachers too, since I'm sure they don't want to be responsible for one of their students missing out on their offers. It'll be interesting to see how university admissions are altered to compensate for all of this in the coming months."
British but being charged international fees because I spent 4 years studying in the US,99,"I‚Äôd say the London university is right. To be considered a home student, you need to be ordinarily resident in the U.K. for the three years before your course starts (e.g. https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/international-students/fee-status-classification), which unfortunately you haven‚Äôt been, whatever the reason. I‚Äôd request a fee status reassessment from both of them to be honest - you wouldn‚Äôt want to get half way through the degree at the Scottish university and suddenly have to pay international fees."
Moving home in 16 hours,98,"All the very best with your future. I‚Äôm sorry that your time at Uni wasn‚Äôt free of heartbreak. I think, on balance, that the social aspect of Uni are underplayed - I learned a LOT more than just Computer Science‚Ä¶"

Feeling like I wasted a year,90,"I‚Äôm in the exact same position. Probably the worst year of my life. It‚Äôs frustrating but you can‚Äôt get the time back now so you might as well push on and try to position yourself better for success next year assuming you end up doing it. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs been a very character building year for you whether you realise it or not, it has been for me."
How bad will taking 6 years to finish undergraduate look to employers?,90,"Hi

I would strongly err towards taking the time and getting a 2.1."
Uni ignoring/preventing me from retaking the 3rd year?,87,"You need to phone them and speak to a human ASAP to explain the urgency; it‚Äôs easy to get lost in a system via email and you need quick, clear answers."
Are repeat years normally capped at 40%?,87,[deleted]
University is where my passion for chemistry died,86,"If the course is causing you this much trouble, consider switching! It will only get worse in third year. 

Are there any parts of your Chemistry course that you are enjoying more (ie Organic more than Theoretical or Physical etc) that you could potentially focus more on or do you find it all the same?

Have you tried taking a textbook out from the library and attempting to learn from that instead of lectures, in case that makes things easier? 

I can completely understand that you feel you are too far in to ‚Äúgive up‚Äù but realistically you‚Äôve only done 1/3"
Found a site that tracks COVID-19 cases in UK universities,84,I would expect southampton to have a higher case rate than other unis simply because they are doing regular saliva testing.
Is online school a real excuse or have I just become lazy?,75,"Online university is completely demoralising, but by the sounds of your current approach and work ethic you could put in some more effort.

You say that you're 'not smart' and that you haven't previously achieved the best grades, however that is completely irrelevant going forward. You are entirely capable of getting the top grades if that is something you really want."
im going to flunk my degree,77,"If you haven't already please go and speak to your University wellbeing services and get some help. You may even qualify for disability support dependent on the history of your mental health. Also speak with someone in your faculty /department - unis do not not want students to fail and you will have options. You are dealing with a lot, please make sure the uni knows about it. Take care."
Has anyone received compensation from their university? Thinking of filing a formal complaint.,75,"Sounds like an administrative issue the university is putting off (i.e. data loss, lack of staff, reallocation of staff - I presume that potentially many university generalists will now be moving into admissions given the current problems).

Nevertheless, sounds like something you should definitely try and raise with a higher authority or perhaps the NUS who could publicise the issue.  If you basically get a 'we don't care' from these organisations, you could attempt to take it to the press, but that would obviously potentially cause you more problems depending on the scale of the institution itself."

Quality of Education over recent years,66,"i tutor CS students privately and id have to agree. I can't say ive taught a second or third year that actually ""likes"" their uni course.

and ngl having marked and read a lot of the assignments they get. I do agree its half-assed, ive read so many ""weird"" or incorrect questions. its clear a lot of places don't have a second person to at least read over and check the assignments before they send them out."
What can I do differently in 3rd year? From someone that had a pretty bad 1st and 2nd year,66,"This year has sucked for students, so pretty much all of your feelings are completely understandable. Imposter syndrome is a bitch! It sounds as if you have a huge amount to be proud of. Keep a routine if you can and keep the exercise going. Try to meet up with people you know. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help. Good luck with next year - hopefully a return to real university life."
What is the best route to ask for a fee reduction?,63,You should contact the office of your Vice-Chancellor or equivalent (some unis call them President I believe)
Tired of feeling so lonely at university,61,"You know there's this common misconception that you're meant to make the best friends of your life at uni. 

Some people do, some people don't. I've made some good friends, I've made some bad friends. 

It's a new experience for everyone in your situation and everyone's in the same boat. 

I know it can be scary but just find someone in the canteen. Just everytime you go in there try and strike up a conversation. It doesn't have to go anywhere, it doesn't have to be meaningful, interesting, engaging. Just talk to someone. Most of the conversations will probably just be polite pleasantries commenting on the state of the world atm and nothing more. But that's fine. Most will probably just be a few sentences, 20 seconds. But that's fine. 

If you make a conversation everytime you go, eventually you'll either meet someone who conversation works well with, or you'll just keep seeing the same people and be recognised. Once you're familiar to people then it's easy from there. It's hard when you're a bit of a ghost (not trying to be rude). 

Basically if there's little chance for social interaction, then what choice do you have but to try when there is a chance. 

You've gotta just grab the bull by the horns, accept that not everyone is gonna wanna talk to you, and similarly you're not going to want to talk to everyone. But you won't know that for certain until you've tried. 

Do this for a couple of days and it should just feel natural and empowering rather than anxious and embarrassing."
Is it true that most UK students don't work alongside their degree?,61,"I would say, from my experience, most do not have a job on the side. I would estimate about a fourth or fifth of students have a job alongside university. That said, when summer break comes, lots look for employment either for experience or much needed cash."
Just tested positive for covid (and still at uni),50,"I think it‚Äôs an extremely difficult situation - you will be putting those around you at risk if you go home. I would definitely take a test on the 23rd &amp; morning of the 24th to see.

If you test negative, you might be okay HOWEVER for the safety of the general public, do not go out with friends and do not use public transport to get home."
University of Southampton Coronavirus Update,54,"University of Manchester hasn't updated their COVID-19 policy since Wednesday, and advise that attendance will be expected as business as usual for the next two weeks until the Easter break.

I have several classmates from China, Denmark and America who have already booked tickets home however. I don't blame them."
Anyone else experienced crippling loneliness as a postgrad?,50,"I'm an international student in the same boat too. I'm renting private accommodation and while the house is good, I feel super lonely. I meet my housemates now and then, say hi and that's about it. 2 of them left home for Christmas this week and the other two will leave later this week. Ive been feeling super lonely and unable to do my work for assignments due next Friday. Only today I reached out for help but didn't receive any response yet."
Social life in sixth form is dead - will it get better in uni?,50,[deleted]
Terrified Of Online Learning?,51,"It depends what your degree is. Also whether you‚Äôre going to be in England or Scotland or NI or Wales because rules can be a bit different. If you‚Äôre doing a STEM degree, it‚Äôs very likely that you will be on campus (likely some online lectures too) - I received word from KCL that STEM degrees like Physics will have to be on campus because of compulsory labs. If you‚Äôre doing something like History or Literature, it will be even more likely you‚Äôll be doing most things online."
I'm the first person in my family going to University and I need some help,50,"If you have been rejected, then it makes no difference if you confirm other choices on UCAS now. The only way to get into your top rejected choice would be to try clearing IF you get the grades you want. Even then, they might not have space - in which case you could take a gap year and reapply (but there is still no guarantee).

Foundation years are not 'humiliating'. They will give you a solid base before you enter first year undergrad. It also might be the case that if you exceed your expectations in your results, they may allow you to skip foundation and enter directly into first year. 

It is always disappointing when your heart is set on somewhere, but many people do not get accepted to their first choice and still have an amazing university experience."
Literally 0 motivation to work?,49,"Try to do all your work in the library where others are also studying, it will motivate you and help you stay focused."
SAAS will not fund my final year,47,Go speak to your university's student union - they'll have an advice service that can help you navigate this. Probably also worth speaking to your department as well.
a real first (half) year experience,46,"You‚Äôre not the only one. We‚Äôll get through this, get our degrees, and move on to better things"
Hands up who's got freshers flu üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,43,I'm pretty sure everyone in my city has some kind of cold or cough at the moment
My university has been ghosting me and i may now not be able to finish my degree,44,"I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably time to make a formal complaint against the university ‚Äî you‚Äôve tried the other routs and they haven‚Äôt responded properly. 

You definitely have proper grounds for a complaint, especially where they‚Äôve clearly broken their own policies in a way that harshly disadvantages you. 

I‚Äôd say collect your evidence together and get in contact with your union about the formal complaints process."
"[Respost] we still need 30 students to fill the survey on values regarding COVID19 vaccinations (18+, UK students)",40,Just completed - would be great if you could do mine too!!

Struggling to fit in at uni,41,[deleted]
How do I partake the mass tuition fee claim due to Covid that I‚Äôve heard so much about?,41,Studentgroupclaim.co.uk might be what you‚Äôre talking about
Anyone has regrets about not partying enough at uni/college?,40,"Don‚Äôt worry - I felt the same when I graduated. There are still people and parties when you leave university, it‚Äôs just that now everyone has a bit more money in their pocket and a few more grownup things going on around them."
48 Hour take home exam strategies?,35,"Hope you don‚Äôt mind but I noticed from your previous posts that you‚Äôre at Durham. I graduated from Durham with an International Relations degree last year (politics department). Not surprised at all to hear that SGIA have been ambiguous about your exams - they are crap. 

My best advice (certainly for your Politics papers at least) would be to go over your existing notes, rewatch any recorded lectures, and take notes from any books/articles on the core reading lists that you haven‚Äôt already read. Once you‚Äôve done that, write out detailed essay plans. A lot of the exam questions are repeated every couple of years, so the exam might contain a question you‚Äôve already seen before.

Don‚Äôt worry about writing ‚Äúas much as possible‚Äù - I‚Äôd aim for about 1500 words. That‚Äôs the formative essay length (or at least it was when I was at Durham!) and is just a little over what you‚Äôd write in an exam. It‚Äôs quality not quantity. 

Feel free to PM if I can provide any more help :)"
MSc Dissertation due in 10 weeks- doable?,36,"I think this is absolutely doable. Commit to start working on it NOW. A dissertation can be overwhelming, so make an action plan and break it down - figure out the main tasks you'll need to get done and then break each one of these down into the constituent subtasks (i.e. not 'write the literature review' but 'read x paper and write a summary'). Definitely utilise your supervisor as much as possible - talk to them about your options for data collection if it is not going to be possible to do what you originally intended. Obviously site visits are likely to be out,  but video/phone interviews are a viable option at the moment (recording on Zoom works well), but if you don't have participants lined up already that might take too much time. Could you explore other options - online survey? Document analysis? Secondary analysis of an existing dataset? I know that my own department has increased flexibility on the kind of methods that will be accepted for the dissertation (e.g. broaden to include things like literature review and more theoretical projects) in acknowledgment of the fact that an empirical project might not be possible for some people at this time (e.g. because they were planning to do ethnography in a school). Good luck!"
Am I quite old to be doing a masters?,39,"Not at all.

If a Masters is what you want to do, then go for it!"
"Second years: what are you doing this summer to help your cv, or prepare for grad applications etc?",35,"Not the best advice you'll get but I've found selling my expertise on Fiverr (specifically proofreading/editing) has been a nice little addition to my CV. Given your language skills, you might like to look at doing something similar. It shows pragmatism, enthusiasm, improves your skills and earns you a little extra cash on the side."
Anyone else had a rather mundane uni experience?,33,"Uni is one of the most boring experiences I've ever had. The content has been as wide as an ocean and as shallow as a puddle and is not interesting or enlightening at all. I thought I'd be an expert in my chosen field by this point, but in the first seminar of a third year module we were taught that libraries give out books and another consisted of nothing but basic HMTL and CSS that we had already been taught the previous two years. Constantly reading uninteresting and often impenetrably pretentious texts that are decades out of date is mindnumbing. Seminars are a waste of time: it's either hours of awkward silence because nobody contributes or just the basic points from the lectures repeated because no-one else has engaged with anything beyond them. Examinations and essays are not a good indicator of someone's knowledge and intelligence, just how good they are at memorising information or writing to the personal standards of a specific person.

Despite loads of people complaining that they don't have any uni friends, every time I try to arrange something I'm met with no response. I just focus on my family and friends I've made prior to and outwith uni at this point.

I'd much prefer to be working and learning useable skills while getting paid, but despite the fact I have the skills and knowledge to be able to do the job I want to do, society has deemed that I require five little letters on my CV before I'm allowed to do so. College was a much better experience as I learned practical, useable skills on a face-to-face basis with lecturers who know what they were doing or even cared about their students, but for some reason it's seen as less prestigious than a university education that doesn't actually teach you anything relevant or enrich you. It merely proves that you can finish a years long course.

I detest uni and I can't wait to be shot of it."
Unsure on my situation at uni this year,34,"If you know you‚Äôre going back to uni then I‚Äôd probably go now, cos now seems like the worst possible year to find anything else useful or interesting to do? Like, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs stuff out there! But it‚Äôs risky to postpone uni for a year without having a good plan of what to do instead.

Do totally get that it‚Äôs not the ideal time to be a student. That‚Äôs kinda just because it‚Äôs not really the ideal time for anything though lol."
"After three years of hating my course, I'm finally excited about university",31,Woooooo. U go girl. Personally I m looking forward to uni so hopefully have a better experience
Would it be possible to persuade to persuade a university to lower the grades of the conditional offer that they've given me?,31,[deleted]
How to deal with flatmate constantly breaking COVID rules?,32,"Have one more serious conversation with her, and tell her that if things don't change immediately you will take further action with the University"
Has anyone else completely given up and is thinking of dropping out?,31,"Okay so I‚Äôm going to be straight up and honest with you, cause I think that will be of most help. It‚Äôs going to be hard to get back from this, but I think you should be able to still. Here are some things you should do: 
1. Contact a counselor or even your GP and get it confirmed that you *are* struggling. Paperwork is everything in uni (sadly) this can also make getting actual help, for depression, planning or otherwise. 
2. Get in contact with the most important people from your course (course administrator, organizers, tutors, whatever) be honest with them, but don‚Äôt make your emails too emotional. Tell them you‚Äôre struggling (no need to go in detail) and that you realize that you‚Äôve made mistakes but are willing to work with them to get back on track (you can even say that you‚Äôre seeking out help for your mental health). 
3. Put in the work to get better. The hardest part by far! Keep in contact with your uni contact points, and try your best cause that‚Äôs all you can do. 

And now: I really hope you will feel better soon. I know how it is. I‚Äôve been suicidal for months, and with uni it‚Äôs been hard. Having a view on uni work that‚Äôs not overwhelming has helped me, making the workload ‚Äòbite sized‚Äô. Please do know that you deserve a place in this world, and that stuff can get better. Please feel free to contact me, I would love to talk to you more. Only if you want to though, no pressure. 

Wishing you the best of luck x"
How do you find work experience / volunteer in a hospital for medicine related degrees?,30,"Not many places are taking on volunteers or students atm. Our trust are taking on student nurses but because the course numbers are enormous the cohort had to be split up in order to accommodate them.

If I were you, maybe look at getting employed in your local NHS trust as a bank health care support worker or porter maybe? I know it's not necessary in the field you want to be in, however it's a good way of familiarising yourself with how wards/hospital departments works.

All the best and good luck!"
Life after Uni‚Ä¶..Depressed and Hopeless ,29,"It sounds like it‚Äôs been one hell of a ride, but try not to let your past dictate the present. Sociability is difficult for a lot of people so you‚Äôre not alone on that one. But the longer you leave this the harder it‚Äôs going to get. Try to get out there, (I know easier said than done) but there will be people who will want to talk to you, we‚Äôre all different and we all have to find our own people. Life is one big game of trial and error. But it is your life at the end of the day. Good or bad it‚Äôs what you‚Äôre getting out of it, nobody is really standing there and keeping count. There is going to be a natural tendency to self-blame when you‚Äôre reflecting on dissatisfaction in your life. Because it‚Äôs one way for your mind to feel in control but it keeps you in a cycle. Give yourself a shot, you‚Äôve got everything to gain."
Ministers plan pre-Christmas Covid lockdown for English universities,29,"No student would stay in their accommodation for a fortnight just before Christmas, they'll go home earlier"
Terrified about leaving Uni,27,"You answer all of your questions in your own post.  


You acknowledge your anxiety, which basically explains all of your issues - what are you doing to combat it (since whatever you are currently doing isn't sufficient).  


You acknowledge your CV is shit - What are you doing about that?

If you're passive and ignore problems they compound."
I got a 2:1!,29,"congrats ! I thought i was going to fail my degree too (especially cuz of train strikes), it‚Äôs a surreal feeling to be rewarded for all the hard work we put in ! good luck in your future :)"
Struggling with final year despite doing well last year.,27,"If it's any consolation, I'm in the same boat: I could've written the same text two or three days ago. Decent first three years, and then 6 weeks into fourth year I've been hit by a massive wave of burnout. I'm frustrated by the coursework and the exams and the expectations, and I hate my dissertation topic. Haven't been able to look at any course stuff for over two weeks because I just get upset whenever I try to. 

Don't drop out - you've come too far! Definitely reach out to your university. Apparently this isn't uncommon among final year students. I spoke to my uni's counselling service (do this!) and they gave me some resources to help with coping and have booked me in for counselling. See if you can get an extension on the coursework and reach out to your lecturer for help starting on it. Make sure you're taking time to do activities that you enjoy. You'll get through this - you just need to get through another month before you get a break."
Can multiple students complain about a lecturer/tutor‚Äôs quality of teaching? What would happen?,27,"You should definitely raise it but you need to be specific about what the problem actually is. As you have described it here, there's nothing actionable. 

To get anyone to do anything about it, you need to put together dates, times, any recordings, module documents to show what was provided. Then compare this to the module learning outcomes  and explain clearly why what was provided isn't meeting the outcome.

You might also try talking to the lecturer together and say basically since they know you are all behind, can they run a couple of extra sessions or find someone with the technical expertise in 3d design to-do so."
