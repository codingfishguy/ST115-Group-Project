    "Instead, we searched for posts that contained the words 'lse' and 'opinion'. We retreived the top thirty posts under this search criteria, and stored the 'Post Title', 'Score' (number of 'upvotes' by other redditers) and 'Top Comment' in a pandas data frame 'df'. This dataframe was then saved to a csv file \"Data/reddit_data.csv\" so that it can accessed from any other files, and crucially, so that the data only needs to be fetched from Reddit.com once. Since the contents of the subreddit is likely to change frequently, it would be inefficent to perform effective analysis using realtime data, so we instead stored data from the site on 12/04/2024.\n",

    "We chose to use the website Reddit to acquire data for many reasons. Firstly, their API is easy to use, reliable and openly accessible to the public. This allowed us to effiently access user-generated content without the computational and legal issues that web scraping would risk. Since the type of textual data we are searching for (the general opinion of LSE) is rarely provided in formatted tables online, using an the Reddit API is the best way to acquire and aggregate this information in a structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the website has a strong user base for university students or people generally interested in the subject, exemplified by the size of the subreddit 'UniUK'. Not only does this give access to a large amount of data, but the posts are detailed and honest. This is because a significant part of the branding for Reddit is the idea of community, where you are likely to find other users who want contribute to the discussion under the protection of anonymity."
